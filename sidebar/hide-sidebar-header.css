/*
 * Description: hide the header of the sidebar, which takes quite a bit of space.
 * Use with caution: you will no longer have a way to switch between sidebar panes,
 * so make sure you have some other way of doing so if you need to.
 * (For example, an extension can add a toolbar button which opens its sidebar pane.)
